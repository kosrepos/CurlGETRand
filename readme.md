# Automated GET request with curl (Bash script)

## Synopsis

A Bash script that sends GET requests to a user-specified server/port/subdirectory with random integers, with values in  [100,500] every 5 seconds, using ```curl```.

## Scenario

We want to test a server/platform using simple data requests/responds.

## Prerequisites

* **Curl** ```sudo apt-get install curl```
